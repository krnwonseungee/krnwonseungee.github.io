<p>I love travel. Instead of boring you with speech about how travel changed my life, I'll talk about one of my proudest accomplishments.</p>

<p>Since Fall 2012 when I spent a semester in Bordeaux, France, I've made it a point to go to a McDonald's in every country I visit.</p>

<p>Joking aside, traveling is a great way to get out of one's element, and I've always made it a point to live out of my comfort zone. If you have any travel stories, I would love to hear them. :)</p>
