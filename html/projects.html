<!--   <p><i>Struggles/Accomplishments</i>: This was the first time I played around with web scraping. I first used Nokogiri, but switched over to Mechanize (which itself uses Nokogiri) in order to extract material from a site's HTML. I struggled with creating the algorithm to scrape from multiple sub-pages after starting from a single main page that contained 205 love poems. I used Mechanize and an "until loop" in order to create an iterative algorithm that would scrape from each sub-page and then return to the main page, while a "master" array collected all the words from all love poems so far. Using this, I sorted all the words in descending frequency, grabbed the 300 most commonly occuring words, shuffled them, and spat it out in my custom, romantic ipsum. -->

<!--   <p><i>Struggles/Accomplishments</i>: This was our final project at Dev Bootcamp and it is a platform for DBC Alumni to set up pairing sessions and to stay in touch. I was responsible for the search bar functionality and rendering the user profile CRUD functions onto a single-page app using AJAX requests and OOJS. For the search bar, we wanted the user to be able to enter in a term and our search engine would return any alumni whose profile contained that search term. I found the PgSearch gem to be useful for this, as it searched across fields in our database and returned any instances that contained the search term. One struggle I had was  </p> -->
